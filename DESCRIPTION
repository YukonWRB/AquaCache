Description: Set of functions for the creation and ongoing maintenance of
    the Yukon Government's hydrometeorological databases in postgreSQL
    format. Contains functions which operate on two databases, the 'snow' and 'aquacache' 
    databases. The former is designed to hold discrete snowpack measurements and 
    detailled snow survey data, while the later is designed to hold hydrometric, 
    meteorological and water quality data along with images, spatial files and documents.
    Currently includes adapters to import data from the Water Survey of Canada (WSC)
    real-time and historical data, date held in Aquarius, USGS data, discrete 
    snow survey data from the snow database created with this package,
    water quality data, images from NuPoint and the WSC, and meteorological 
    data in the form of timeseries observations are unique locations and rasters (with special handling for forecast rasters). 
    Supports any number of timeseries unique by their location,
    parameter, data type, and period (for sum, mean, etc. measurements).
    Disparate data sources are handled via import scripts and function arguments specified for each
    timeseries/sample series/raster series/image series, allowing for great flexibility.
