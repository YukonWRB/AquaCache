Description: Set of functions for the creation and ongoing maintenance of
    the Yukon Government's hydrometeorological database in postgreSQL format. This
    database is a combination of the Water Survey of Canada real-time and
    historical data, YG data held in Aquarius and in the RWIS database, USGS data, and discrete
    snow survey data. Supports any number of timeseries unique by their
    location, parameter, data type, and period (for sum, mean, etc
    measurements). Disparate data sources are handled via scripts
    specified for each timeseries, allowing for expansion of data sources.
