\description{
Add watershed polygons to the database, stored in a separate folder alongside the database itself. Currently works only with WSC stations, as uses existing watershed polygons created by the WSC. Each watershed gets a folder containing the polygon, the associated pour point, and the monitoring location itself. In addition, a single shapefile is created containing only the watershed polygons.
