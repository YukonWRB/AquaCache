\arguments{
\item{con}{A connection to the database. Default NULL uses AquaConnect() and closes the connection afterwards.}

\item{path}{Path to a document/file to attach to the borehole record. If NULL, no document is attached.}

\item{well_name}{Name of the borehole/well. Required.}

\item{latitude}{The latitude coordinate of the borehole location. Required.}

\item{longitude}{The longitude coordinate of the borehole location. Required.}

\item{location_source}{Source of the location information (e.g., "GPS", "Survey").}

\item{surveyed_ground_elev}{Ground elevation from survey in meters.}

\item{purpose_of_borehole}{Purpose of the borehole as integer matching the database's borehole_well_purpose column.}

\item{purpose_borehole_inferred}{Logical indicating if the purpose of the borehole is inferred (TRUE) or explicit in documentation (FALSE). Default is FALSE.}

\item{depth_to_bedrock}{Depth to bedrock in meters.}

\item{permafrost_present}{Logical indicating if permafrost is present. Default is FALSE.}

\item{permafrost_top}{Depth to the top of permafrost in meters, if present.}

\item{permafrost_bot}{Depth to the bottom of permafrost in meters, if present.}

\item{date_drilled}{Date when the borehole was drilled.}

\item{casing_od}{Outside diameter of the casing in centimeters.}

\item{is_well}{Logical indicating if the borehole is also a well. Default is FALSE.}

\item{well_depth}{Total depth of the well in meters.}

\item{top_of_screen}{Depth to the top of the well screen in meters.}

\item{bottom_of_screen}{Depth to the bottom of the well screen in meters.}

\item{well_head_stick_up}{Height of the well head above ground in meters.}

\item{static_water_level}{Static water level measured from the top of the well in meters.}

\item{estimated_yield}{Estimated yield of the well in liters per minute.}

\item{ground_elev_m}{Ground elevation in meters.}

\item{notes_borehole}{Additional notes about the borehole.}

\item{notes_well}{Additional notes about the well.}

\item{share_with_borehole}{A character vector of the user group(s) with which to share the borehole, one element per group. Default is "public_reader".}

\item{drilled_by}{Company or individual who drilled the borehole.}

\item{drill_method}{Method used for drilling.}

\item{purpose_of_well}{Purpose of the borehole as integer matching the database's borehole_well_purpose column. Default is \code{purpose_of_borehole}.}

\item{purpose_well_inferred}{Logical indicating if the purpose of the borehole is inferred (TRUE) or explicit in documentation (FALSE). Default is \code{purpose_borehole_inferred}.}

\item{share_with_well}{A character vector of the user group(s) with which to share the well, one elemtn per group. Default is \code{share_with_borehole}.}
}
\value{
The borehole_id of the newly inserted record.
}
\description{
This function facilitates the addition of a borehole record to the database. If the borehole
is also a well, additional well-specific information can be provided. The function can also
associate a document with the borehole and handle permafrost information if present.
