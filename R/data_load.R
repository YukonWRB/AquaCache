#' Polygons of provinces with 300km buffers

#' Storing and loading package spatial data is tricky! For shapefiles, the sf or terra package is required but loading internal data can't be done with a specific package (loading a .rda file doesn't allow that). Requiring this package to be loaded just to load internal data doesn't make much sense. Instead, delayedAssign below waits until "prov_buff" is called and then uses the code, including a terra call, to load the shapefile as a terra object.
