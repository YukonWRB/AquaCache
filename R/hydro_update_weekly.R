#' Weekly update of hydro database

#' @param path The path to the local hydro SQLite database, with extension.
#' @param WSC_range The starting date from which to pull real-time WSC data from the web and replace in the local database. Default is max possible days.
#' @param aquarius_range Should only unapproved (locked) data be replaced, or all available data? Select from "all" or "unapproved". Default is "unapproved".
#'
#' @return Updated entries in the hydro database.
